              yet confusing question. <br>

              We understand that because of stereotypes that men have been facing since a long
              time , it is difficult for them to express thier emotions and feelings.
             <br> But suppressing it can lead to suffering, depression and mental health issues.
              So, Do we have a solution to 
              this? <br><em> Yes, Ofcourse we do but your willingness matters a lot!</em>

        <img src="prob1.jpg" alt="mental health issues"><br><br>
       
         <h4> <strong>What are the different conditions of mental health issue in men?</strong></h4> <br><br>
          <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 5px;">
        <strong>Depression:</strong> Both men and women can experience depression, but the signs and
         symptoms can be different.

        Though the primary symptoms of depression  for many is feeling of sadness,men can have a higher tendency 
        than women to feel anger, demonstrate aggressive feelings, and engage in substance abuse. 
        But men are typically less likely to talk about their emotions and seek treatment for depression than women, 
        many men may have undiagnosed depression. <br><br>

        <strong>Anxiety:</strong> Men are less likely to identify that they are experiencing a problem with 
          anxiety and/or connect with their emotional experience of anxiety.
          If they do connect with the emotional problem they are more likely to minimise the severity of the
           problem and carry on without looking for help and support.
          When they do seek help it is often at the latter stages when things have become more severe, if at all.
          Anxiety problems may be more difficult to identify in men and therefore men may be less likely
           to be diagnosed with a problem when they do present to services.<br><br>
         
           <strong>Schizophrenia:</strong> Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder in which people interpret reality abnormally. 
           Schizophrenia may result in some combination of hallucinations, delusions, and extremely disordered thinking and 
           behavior that impairs daily functioning, and can be disabling.People with schizophrenia require lifelong treatment. 
           Early treatment may help get symptoms under control before serious complications develop and may help improve the
            long-term outlook.Men and women are equally likely to get this brain disorder, but guys tend to get it slightly earlier. 
            On average, men are diagnosed in their late teens to early 20s.<br><br>

            <strong>PTSD:</strong> Millions of people suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
             Unfortunately, doctors do not always spot PTSD symptoms in men. Until men can get a diagnosis and realize that they have PTSD.
            When men undergo some form of trauma, they may not get treatment for it right away. Often, men do not realize that they have PTSD. 
            They internalize their symptoms and assume that something is wrong with them. Once men understand that their symptoms are from an 
            external experience or trauma, they can get help for it.
            Being able to realize that there is a problem is hard enough. They may avoid activities and situations that remind them of the 
            traumatic experience. Men are more likely to use alcohol or drugs to cope.<br><br>

        <strong style="font-size: large;">What can one do to cope up with mental health issues?</strong> <br> <br>

        <strong>Self-Acceptance: </strong><br> first step toward being able to better cope with your mental health disorder should include radical
         self-acceptance, which is fully accepting something with your heart and your mind.
          In essence, this means coming to terms with the fact that no matter what you cannot change
           a situation or the circumstances that led up to it. In the context of a mental health disorder, 
           for example, accepting the fact that you have a problem as opposed to pretending it doesn’t exist
            can incentivize you to seek help and also make self-care a priority.
             After all, you can’t resolve a problem in your life without first acknowledging that you have one.
             <br><br>

          <strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</strong><br> There are quite a few different types of psychotherapy
           a patient can undergo when seeking treatment for a mental illness. Perhaps the most popular and 
           effective form, however, is cognitive behavioral therapy. To put it in simple terms, cognitive
            behavioral therapy is a short-term practical approach to treating mental illness and focuses on 
            the psychiatrist teaching the patient goal-oriented and problem-identification strategies for 
            managing their condition.Cognitive behavioral therapy is quite effective as the sole form of 
            treatment for many patients with conditions such as depression and generalized anxiety disorder,
             and as previously mentioned, also works exceptionally well in conjunction with medication.
              Although the bulk of cognitive behavioral therapy is short-term, it produces lasting results as 
              the patients will have learned the necessary strategies to manage their mental health.
                 <br><br>

            <strong>Medication: </strong> <br>When most individuals think about treatment for mental illnesses,
             chances are the first thing, or one of the first things, their minds land on is medication. 
             There are medications dedicated to treating specific mental illnesses, such as medication for
              schizophrenia, as well as others that have proven useful at treating more than one mental illness, 
              such as antidepressants. In addition to treating depression, antidepressants are also helpful with 
              generalized anxiety disorder. It is important to note due to the many types of medication, even 
              within one mental illness, patients often have to try more than one medication and adjust dosages 
              over a period for their doctors to discover what works best. As an example, one common type of
               antidepressant is serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Even if one patient receives the same
                SSRI as a friend or relative also suffering from depression, it could be at a different dose.
                 Alternatively, it could be a different SSRI in addition to a different dose.
